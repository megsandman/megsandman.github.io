      <p><span class="posttitle">Tech Talk: SQL v. NoSQL</span><br><span class="postdate">September 20, 2014</span></p>


      <p class="posttext">This week we dove into SQL - short for Structured Query Language - and have had an introduction to databases and database management systems (DMS). The DMS is the piece that handles the sets of information and SQL is a language that gives users a way to interact with that data. SQL allows you to create a database, add or delete information from it, or pull information from it based on specified parameters.</p>

      <p class="posttext">SQL databases are relational databases. This means that the data is stored in tables (also known as relations) with each table contains rows, which each contain a unique record, and columns, which are also referred to as attributes.  You can create relationships between the tables to form a very powerful and large dataset that is easier to access and query than if all the data had been stored in one single table. </p>

      <p class="posttext">Some of the benefits of SQL include:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>Ease of use. Even after just few days of learning SQL I&#39;ve been surprised by how much I&#39;m able to do. The syntax is very readable and easy to pick up and with just a small set of commands users are able to perform a powerful number of operations.</li>
      <li>Standardization. SQL is an established standard that has been used for a long time so there is agreement among the community on best practices and a large amount of open source work available.</li>
      <li>Complex data. SQL databases handle complex data very well and allows users to easily and quickly perform powerful operations.</p></li></ul>

      <p class="posttext">And a few of the drawbacks:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>It&#39;s rigid. When creating a database, you must use a predefined schema, which means that you must know the structure of the data set you will be collecting ahead of time. This can be too rigid in fields like web development.</li>
      <li>SQL only works in tables. This is not always the best way to store some data types, like hierarchical data.</li>
      <li>Scale vertically. SQL databases are easy to scale vertically but not horizontally, which means that in order to increase the power of the database you need to increase the load on each node rather than spreading the load out over additional nodes.</li></ul>

      <p class="posttext">Because of some of the problems mentioned above with SQL several other languages have emerged. One of those is NoSQL, which is short for Not Only SQL. While SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational (also called distributed), which means that instead of being stored in tables the data is stored in key-value pairs, graphs, documents, or columns.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Some of the benefits of NoSQL:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>Less structured than SQL. NoSQL databases are dynamic and do not require a schema to be pre-defined.</li>
      <li>Scale horizontally. You can increase the load of the database by adding additional nodes and reducing the load on each node.</li>
      <li>Good with large data sets and hierarchical data sets because NoSQL databases allow for data stored in key-value pairs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="posttext">There are also a few drawbacks of NoSQL:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>Less standardization. Because it is much newer and less rigid, NoSQL does not have the standards and level of best practices in place that SQL has. This also makes it more risky for use of sensitive data.</li>
      <li>Difficulty with complex queries. SQL is more adept at handling complex queries than SQL.</li></ul>

      <p class="posttext">As I continue to learn more about both languages, I&#39;m excited to better understand the ins and outs of each so that I&#39;ll be able to identify the best database structure for projects I work on.
