        <h1> GPS 1.1 Pairing </h1>
        <h2> By Ariana Vergara and Meg Sandman</h2>

        <p id="text"> Usually the driver is the individual who writes the code. The navigator directs the driver and stears the direction of the code. The two programmers are supposed to swithc roles frequently. The driver is supposed to focus all of his or her attention on the tactical aspects while the observer is the safety net.</p>

        <p id="bottomtext">Reflection: We had a good first pairing session! We were both came into this with an open mindset since neither of us had paired before. It really helped that we were both open and upfront in the begining about how we were feeling that day, what we were concerned about, etc. and kept that communication going throughout the session. I think next time we could do a better job of stikcking to the driver/navigator roles. We seemed to blur the lines a little, and we each need to feel more comfortable moving things forward in the navigator role.</p>
