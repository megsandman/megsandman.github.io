      <p><span class="posttitle">Pairing and feedback: Learning from my peers.</span><br><span class="postdate">September 7, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">I've written in a <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/pair-programming.html">previous post</a> about how pair programming and working through challenges with the other students in the cohort plays a big roll in DBC. While we do have a challenge that we must work on individually each week, I&#39;ve found myself pairing with others on most of the other challenges. After my first few pairing session, I realized that working with another student allows me to learn so much more than I could compared with just trying to solve the challenges on my own. I&#39;ve learned as much about Ruby from working with other students as I have through reading texts like <a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/" target="_blank">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a> and having my peers explain a complicated concept in a slightly different way has helped me understand the material better, as has explaining concepts to the person I&#39;m working with.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Not only has pairing been beneficial on the technical side, but it has been incredibly valuable in teaching me to communicate better. It&#39;s forced me to think out loud so that the person I&#39;m working with knows exactly what is going through my head and what aspect of the challenge I&#39;m working on. Good communication is not easy and at times has been a point of frustration. During the Phase 0 prep period all students are remote so the pairing sessions are done via Google hangouts and being remote adds in an additional layer of complexity. There have been times during pairing sessions where I felt my point could have been better conveyed via a simple drawing or by jotting my idea down on paper. Since Ruby and programming are still so new to me, I&#39;m not yet fully comfortable articulating my thoughts in a clear and concise way and have found myself at times stumbling through an explanation of my idea.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While at times frustrating, pairing can also be incredibly fun. When working on a challenge, I tend to cycle through a full spectrum of emotions: the excitement of first starting a problem inevitably turns into confusion. I&#39;ll be lost, unsure what to do next and just looking at my code will make my brain hurt. As frustration starts to creep in, I know it&#39;s time to take a break. Returning to the challenge with fresh eyes brings back the sense of eagerness to tackle the problem and once I finally solve it, I have the most amazing feeling of accomplishment. Working with a partner has helped me reign in my emotions and keep a little bit of a steadier keel - except for when we successfully get through the problem. It is so much more rewarding to have someone to share the win with, and this is my favorite part of pair programming.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Feedback is another pillar of DBC. We submit feedback for our partner following each pairing session. We do code reviews of others&#39; solutions and provide feedback on what we learned from reading their code and thoughts on how they could improve their code. We even provide feedback on feedback that other students have submitted. </p>

      <p class="posttext">Anytime I&#39;m about to read feedback, I feel my anxiety level rise. The perfectionist in me wants to do everything right and cringes at the thought of having others point out areas where I can be doing better. It&#39;s humbling to be reminded every day of how much I still have left to learn and I&#39;m working on trying not to be so hard on myself and to embrace the fact that I came to DBC to learn a completely new skillset, one with which I had no prior experience. Constructive feedback from my peers, like pairing sessions, has been incredibly valuable in accelerating my learning.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Writing good feedback is hard. DBC uses the ASK framework for feedback, which guides us to make our comments actionable, specific, and kind. Vague statements like &quot;I enjoyed pairing with you&quot; don&#39;t let the person receiving the feedback know what they did that made the pairing session so enjoyable, which means they do not know which behaviours they should continue in their next sessions. Kind feedback is not the same as nice - it does not mean that you can only write positive things about the person but rather means that the feedback is written from a constructive place rather than a negative one.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While providing this amount of feedback is time consuming, I&#39;m very thankful that DBC requires us to do it.  Receiving regular feedback will guide my learning and ensure that nothing is falling through the cracks. Additionally, building this skill will serve us well throughout our careers and will allow us to provide value to those around us in areas outside of just writing good code.</p>
