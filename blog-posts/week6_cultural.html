      <p><span class="posttitle">Stereotype threat: how the groups we identify with can impact our performance.</span><br><span class="postdate">September 12, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">I find human behavior fascinating. I wrote my senior thesis in college on how non-concious factors impact human behavior and the topic is one that is near and dear to my heart. It never ceases to amaze me that our actions and behavior can be so heavily affected by influences we are not aware of. One very powerful influence on our behavior is the stereotypes with which we associate.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Coined by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/" target="_blank">Dr. Claude Steele</a>, stereotype threat refers to the threat &quot;the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype, or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype&quot;. Prompted by the higher college dropout rate and lower GPAs for black students than white students, Dr. Steele began researching the causes behind these differences. He found that, economic resources being equal, black students perform worse than white students on standardized tests when they were prompted to think about their race. When their race was not emphasized, the black students&#39; performance was on par with the white students&#39;. Simply thinking about one&#39;s race and the stereotypes associated with it hindered the black student&#39;s performance.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Dr. Steele&#39;s findings have since been replicated on may different groups. Women perform worse on math tests when prompted to think about their gender. White men perform worse at sports traditionally dominated by black men. Details on additional studies can be found <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">As a woman entering a <a href="week4_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">male-dominated field</a>, stereotype threat is a particularly important thing for me to be aware of. I know that I can be my own toughest critic and that this can sometimes hold me back, but the thought that I could be handicapping my own performance simply because of the stereotypes associated with my gender is frightening. I went to an all-female junior high and high school and because of that grew up thinking that I, as a girl, could do anything I set my mind to. It's important that as I embark on this new adventure that I remember that.</p>
