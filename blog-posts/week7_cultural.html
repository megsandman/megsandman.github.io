      <p class="posttext">When I think about the times in my life that I&#39;ve been happiest or most proud, a few themes come to mind: adventure, challenge, close relationships, growth, integrity, meaningful work, personal development. Of these, growth is one that I value most. It&#39;s important to me that I am always learning and developing, whether it be in my career, my relationships, or in another area of interest and this is exactly what led me to Dev Bootcamp in the first place. I want to be the best possible version of myself that I can be, and the only way to do that is to constantly be growing and improving.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While growth is particularly important to me, I try to live up to and embody all of these values as much as possible. They encapsulate what&#39;s most important to me and the type of person I want to be while also helping to guide me when I&#39;m frustrated or have an important decision to make.  I know that Dev Bootcamp is going to be incredibly challenging but focusing on these values will help remind me why I chose this path. I want learn. I want to push myself. I want to be solving interesting problems. In the seven weeks that I have been in Phase 0 I have been doing all of those things and more.</p>

      <p class="posttext">These values and the importance of keeping them top of mind throughout DBC tie in nicely with <a href ="week6_cultural.html">last week&#39;s post about stereotype threat </a>. Stereotype threat can occur when one identifies with a group that has a negative stereotype associated with it. In my case, I run the risk of letting the fact that women are traditionally thought of as not being as successful in the STEM fields negatively impact my performance in those areas and at DBC in particular. I believe the key for me will be to stay grounded in my values and to focus on my goals rather than generalizations about the female sex as a whole.</p>
