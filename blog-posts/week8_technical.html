      <p class="posttext">As I have had conversations with friends and various people I meet about Dev Bootcamp, the question of what language I&#39;m learning virtually always comes up. When I say Ruby, I&#39;m frequently asked &quot;Oh, like Ruby on Rails?&quot; My response to date has gone something along the lines of an unsure &quot;Umm, yes?&quot; I didn&#39;t actually know what Rails was or how it differed from Ruby so I decided to do a little research to better understand the relationship between Ruby and Rails.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Rails is an open source software framework used to create dynamic web applications. Ruby is an object oriented programming language on which the Rails framework is built. Frameworks are designed to simplify a developer&#39;s life by making it easier to build and maintain web applications. When building a web application, there is a basic setup that most developers will need to get started including access to libraries, database integration, and templating. The framework takes care of all of these basic needs by building a development environment for web applications.</p>

      <p class="posttext">At the core of Rails is the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture pattern. This pattern divides the application into three separate but connected components in order to differentiate how the user interacts with each piece:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>Model: The model is independent of the user and does not interact with him or her at all. It stores and manages the data and the basic logic of the program and feeds information to the view. In Rails, the model typically consists of a database and a file (or files) of Ruby code.</li>
      <li>View: The view is what the user sees - it is how the output and data from the model is presented to the user. In Rails, the View typically compiled in HTML.</li>
      <li>Controller: The controller takes in requests and data from the user and these are in turn sent to the model.</li></ul>


      <p class="posttext">The following chart clearly illustrates the cyclical relationship between the three components:</p>

      <p class="posttext">Rails employs two design principles that are common in several other frameworks:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>&quot;Convention over Configuration&quot; (CoC): Rails has a default way of doing things - a set of conventions that are built into the framework rather than having to be specified in the code. Rather than having to write out every single configuration detail, Rails only requires that you specify when you would like to deviate from these standards. Which ties in with the next principle...</li>

      <li>&quot;Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself&quot; (DRY): This principle encourages developers to eliminate duplication in code. Any code that needs to be repeated should be automated. In DRY code, &quot;every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.&quot; (<a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself" target="_blank">97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</a>). Not only does this make the code shorter, simpler, and easier to understand, but it also makes the code easier to debug and maintain. If there is an error in the code, you fix if once and then you&#39;re done rather than having to search through the code to find any other instances of the error.</li></ul>

      <p class="posttext">Rather than fumbling through my answer to questions I get about Ruby and Rails, I&#39;ll be able to give a much clearer answer: Ruby is the programming language that powers the Rails web application development framework.
