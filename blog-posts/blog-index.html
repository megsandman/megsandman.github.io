      <p class="posttext">When I started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (DBC), I didn't know anything about front-end web development. I had made a few edits to the html tags on a Blogger site I used to keep but beyond that, I wouldn't have known where to start in creating a web page. Fast forward two weeks, and I've built <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html" target = "_blank">my own website</a>, including this blog, from scratch using HTML and CSS. For those who are unfamiliar (like I was before DBC), HTML is used to put all the elements (like images or this text) on the page while CSS is used to position and style these elements.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Positioning elements has been one of the hardest concepts for me to grasp. Getting each piece of text and each border in the exact right spot was a character-building experience. Tears may have been shed. So how does positioning work in CSS? I’m so glad you asked. Let me give a quick overview.</p>

      <p class="posttext">By default, elements are given a static position. If you don't tell them where to go, they will fall on the page in the order in which they are written in the HTML document, one right after another. If you only have one element on the page, say a red square, it will plop itself in the upper left corner of the page. As you add more elements (or red squares) to a page, they will continue to line up horizontally, moving down to the next line once the top line is full.</p>

      <p class="posttext">There are three types of positioning that can be applied: relative, absolute, and fixed. With relative positioning, you move the element relative to where it would have fallen if it had no positioning applied and had the default static position. You can apply positioning attributes to move the element around. For example, if I add top: 10px, the element will be shifted down 10 pixels from where the element would have normally fallen because I've added a 10 pixel margin to the top of the element. If I do not add any positioning attributes (e.g. I don't tell the element to move up, down, right, or left) then the element will remain in it's default position.</p>

      <p class="posttext">With relative positioning, placement of an element is still dependent on the flow of all elements within the document. You are moving an element relative to where it would have fallen. Absolute positioning takes the element out of this flow and allows you to place it anywhere on the page. Like with the relative position, you use positioning attributes on the top, bottom, right, and left to adjust the location, but in this case you are adjusting it relative to either the top of the page or the element's parent. An element's parent is the element that contains that element. For example, the parent element of this paragraph of text is the rectangular container that outlines this blog post. Absolute positioning allows me to decide where this paragraph is displayed relative to the position of this container. If an element does not have a parent element or if the parent element has a static position, then absolute positioning allows you to to move the element relative to the top left of the page.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Finally, the fixed position locks an element in a specific spot on the page, even when you move up and down the page. Keep your eye on the navigation bar at the top of the page and scroll down. See how it stays in place while the "Meg Makes" and the top of the post flow up underneath it? This happens because the navigation bar has a fixed position - it is anchored to that spot and will not move at all.</p>

      <p class="posttext">There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there, but one of the things that I think sets Dev Bootcamp apart is their emphasis on creating well rounded engineers who will thrive in their post-DBC work place rather than focusing exclusively on teaching students to code. This holistic approach along with the way they empower students to take control of their education really make the program stand out and after watching <a href ="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">this fireside chat</a> with DBC founder Shereef Bishay, I'm even more excited to be part of the DBC family.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In the video, Shereef discusses the two different mindsets he sees in students using a restaurant analogy: students are either sitting at the table or working in the kitchen.  He urges students to choose the later path and take ownership and responsibility over their time at DBC. Come in, make a mess, and amaze yourself with how much you are able to learn and teach in nine short weeks. He warns against just "ordering off the menu" and feeling you are owed or entitled to a certain experience.</p>

      <p class="posttext">It's incredibly inspiring to know that what I get out of DBC is completely in my control. I'm pumped to start and to see what I'm capable of. I'm excited to test my limits and push myself harder than I ever have before. I'm not going to lie, I'm a little nervous. It's going to be a intense and a complete emotional roller coaster, but I also know that if I felt completely confident about the program that I wouldn't be pushing myself hard enough. Let's do this!</p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="t1-compare-websites.html" class="title-link">Website design and user experience.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 9, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">First DBC blog post! Very exciting. This week we learned about design and user experience to help us put together our blogs. This whole process really forced me to think about some of the characteristics that I value when looking at other websites. There are a few things that are top of mind:</p>

      <p>
        <ul  class="posttext">
          <li><strong>Clean and simple:</strong> Is the page uncluttered? Does it provide just the right amount of information without causing me to get distracted?</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to navigate:</strong> Can I easily find what I'm looking for? Is it clear where I should focus my attention? Does the flow of the content make sense?</li>
          <li><strong>Engaging:</strong> does the website provide some sort of value? Does it keep me interested?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="posttext">Three websites come to mind that really exemplify these characteristics: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="http://www.shopbop.com/"target="_blank">Shopbop</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/"target="_blank">Google</a>. The New Yorker's website has a large amount of content, but they do a great job of organizing it so that the user is not overwhelmed when looking at the page. I find text-heavy websites difficult to process quickly. Since The New Yorker is a magazine and people go to their website to read their articles, the website could have easily been primarily text based with a laundry list of article titles for users to sift through. One of the things I really enjoy about the site is that they do a nice job of bringing the top articles to life by adding images and a sentence or two with additional details about the article. This allows me as user to make a quick decision around whether I want to click the link and read the article or not. Additionally, they curate the experience. They don't list all articles in the current issue on the front page. That information is easy to navigate to, but they focus the users attention and highlight a few key articles the want you to look at.</p>

      <img class="displayed" src="shopbop.png" />

      <p class="posttext">Shopbop is my favorite place to shop online. When I'm looking at clothing online, pictures play a huge role when I am deciding whether to buy an item or not. Shopbop does a fantastic job of merchandising the clothing with high-quality photos that speak for themselves. The white background and clean layout really make the photos pop and draw the user in. They do a fantastic job of creating emotion through the photos. While they are in the business of selling clothing, they are really selling a lifestyle that they want the user to aspire to, with the clothes helping facilitate that lifestyle. Shopbop is also incredibly easy to navigate. Large tabs along the bottom of the header direct the user to more specific categories, which allows even a new user to quickly find what ever she is looking for.</p>

      <p class="posttext">You can't really get more simple than the Google website, and that's one of the main reasons I like it so much. It does one thing -- lets you search for content on the Internet -- and it does that one thing really well. All the white space on the page focuses your attention on the search box. There is no question about where you are supposed to look on the page or what value the site provides, which creates a great user experience. While Google now has many different products and services, their minimalist website focuses the user on their bread and butter: search.</p>

      <p class="posttext">All three of these websites serve very different purposes, but to me they are all great examples of how strong design impacts user experience. And as you can probably tell from the sites I mentioned here and the design of this blog, I'm a big fan of minimalist white backgrounds with black text.</p>
