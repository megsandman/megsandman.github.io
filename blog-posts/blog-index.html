      <p class="posttext">As I shared the news that I was going to do Dev Bootcamp and learn to code with friends and acquaintances, everyone has been very supportive and excited for me. Invariably, after sharing their excitement for me, each reaction has typically included a comment along the lines of &quot;we need more female programmers&quot; or &quot;a woman who codes? You&#39;re going to  be so marketable.&quot; </p>

      <p class="posttext">Ruby is an object oriented language. This means that everything in Ruby is an object and programs written in Ruby create objects, decide what actions these objects can perform, and decide how these objects interact with other objects. Every object has a class, which is a data structure that groups together objects that have the same behaviors and properties. Ruby allows users to define their own classes but also has several built in classes such as strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Before starting Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp asked students to read up on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target = "_blank">Gregorc Model</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target = "_blank">quiz</a> to determine our own thinking style. The Gregorc Model looks at thinking styles along two dimensions: perceptual quality, which can be either concrete or abstract, and ordering ability, which can be either sequential or random. My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. What does that mean? I like order. I like structure. I don&#39;t do well with ambiguity or abstract ideas. For those of you who know me well, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>

      <p class="posttext">We spent the first two weeks of Phase 0 learning the basics of HTML and CSS, enough that we could build our own blog and <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html">website</a>. This week we shifted our focus to JavaScript, a language that is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. Fun fact: did you know that Java and JavaScript are two completely different, unrelated languages? I didn&#39;t either, <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/05/javascript/" target = "_blank">but they are.</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">As the popularity of mobile phones and tablets continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly common for users to view web content somewhere other than on their computer. Each new device seems to come with  different screen dimensions and ensuring that a page displays properly on each of these screens, regardless of their size, presents a new challenge for web designers. As a user, there’s nothing worse than trying to read an article on your iPhone and having to constantly scroll to the right because the line of text extends beyond the width of the screen. Enter responsive design.</p>

      <p class="posttext">One of the first things we were introduced to upon starting Phase 0 was the concept of pair programming. No, the DBC experience, thankfully, is not all about me sitting at my computer coding away and trying to solve problems on my own. The community is such a large part of the program and as part of that we will be spending a large percentage of our time programming with a partner.</p>

        <p class="posttext">When I started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (DBC), I didn't know anything about front-end web development. I had made a few edits to the html tags on a Blogger site I used to keep but beyond that, I wouldn't have known where to start in creating a web page. Fast forward two weeks, and I've built <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html" target = "_blank">my own website</a>, including this blog, from scratch using HTML and CSS. For those who are unfamiliar (like I was before DBC), HTML is used to put all the elements (like images or this text) on the page while CSS is used to position and style these elements.</p>

      <p class="posttext">There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there, but one of the things that I think sets Dev Bootcamp apart is their emphasis on creating well rounded engineers who will thrive in their post-DBC workplace rather than focusing exclusively on teaching students to code. This holistic approach along with the way they empower students to take control of their education really make the program stand out and after watching <a href ="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">this fireside chat</a> with DBC founder Shereef Bishay, I'm even more excited to be part of the DBC family.</p>
