      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="week4_technical.html" class="title-link">Tech talk: The basics of hashes.</span><br><span class="postdate">August 30, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">Ruby is an object oriented language. This means that everything in Ruby is an object and programs written in Ruby create objects, decide what actions these objects can perform, and decide how these objects interact with other objects. Every object has a class, which is a data structure that groups together objects that have the same behaviors and properties. Ruby allows users to define their own classes but also has several built in classes such as strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Before I started learning Ruby, I was familiar with strings, integers, and arrays, but hashes were completely new. What are hashes? The official <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html" target = "_blank"> Ruby Documentation </a> defines a hash as &quot;a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.&quot; While arrays are ordered lists where a value is identified by it&#39;s index, hashes are un-ordered and values are identified by calling their key. Like arrays, you can use any object type in hashes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Let&#39;s walk through an example to better understand when one would use hashes and how they are implemented in Ruby. I really enjoy hiking and would love a way to keep track of the various trails I hear about in the Bay Area as well as the length of the hikes on each trail. Hashes are the perfect way to do this because they allow you to create a searchable database that ties these two pieces of information together. Here&#39;s how we create the hash:</p>

      <img class="code_snipits" src="../imgs/hikes.png" />

      <p class="posttext">We define the hash called bay_area_hikes and the names of the trails (such as &quot;Mt. Tam&quot;) are the keys while the lengths of the hikes (such as 6.7) are the values. If I&#39;m thinking about doing the Alamere Falls hike but want to make sure it&#39;s not too long, I can easily pull up the length of the hike by calling:</p>

      <img class="code_snipits" src="../imgs/hike_length.png" />

      <p class="posttext">Hashes are not static so if at any time I decide I don't like a particular hike and want to remove it, I can do so. Likewise, if I want to add a new hike to my collection, I can easily do so. Here's how I would add the Mount Diablo Grand Loop hike, which is 6.2 miles long:</p>

      <img class="code_snipits" src="../imgs/add_hike.png" />

      <p class="posttext">I can also write simple functions that will search the hash for information that I want. For example, let's say I want to be able to find any hikes in my collection that are longer than a minimum length:</p>

      <img class="code_snipits" src="../imgs/min_length_function.png" />

      <p class="posttext">The above function takes in a hash of trail name and trail length key-value pairs and minimum length and will return all hikes in the hash that are longer or equal to the minimum length. If I call the function on our bay_area_hikes hash with a minimum length of 7.5, it will return Alamere Falls and Big Basin Waterfall Loop.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Hashes allow us to store information in an organized way that is both easily accessible and searchable. While this was a very basic example, I hope it helps illustrate the power and utility of hashes when are dealing with a collection of data pairs. </p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="week3_cultural.html" class="title-link">Learning and thinking styles.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 24, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">Before starting Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp asked students to read up on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target = "_blank">Gregorc Model</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target = "_blank">quiz</a> to determine our own thinking style. The Gregorc Model looks at thinking styles along two dimensions: perceptual quality, which can be either concrete or abstract, and ordering ability, which can be either sequential or random. My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. What does that mean? I like order. I like structure. I don&#39;t do well with ambiguity or abstract ideas. For those of you who know me well, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In the first three weeks of Phase 0, my biggest struggle has been remembering how to be a student again. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve been focused on learning and digesting large volumes of new information, and I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s been difficult for me to work in large chunks of time without getting distracted or losing focus.</p>

      <p class="posttext">I&#39;ve changed a few things about the way I approached the work this past week that helped me get past my initial challenge. First, I broke down the blocks of time I was spending working into smaller chunks. I gave myself more frequent breaks, and improved my ability to focus. Instead of telling myself that I would work for two hours straight, I divided that up into 4 30-minute blocks with a short break in between each. I&#39;ve found that I&#39;ve been able to accomplish so much more and sustain my focus by working in shorter bursts.</p>


      <p class="posttext">The second strategy I used was to organize my week up front. Each week we are given around 10 challenges that need to be completed with each challenge including reading and other learning materials to get through in addition to the exercises. By mapping out everything that I needed to get done that week in a format that was easily digestible, I was able to give myself a clearer picture of the assignments and could develop a plan of attack. I started setting individual deadlines for each challenge so that I wasn&#39;t tempted to procrastinate knowing that I had the whole week to complete the work.</p>
      <p class="posttext"></p>

      <p class="posttext">Reading about my thinking style and the characteristics associated with it has also highlighted an area that I would like to improve on: experimenting and being more creative. I find that I can get so focused on following directions and doing things &quot;right&quot; that I don&#39;t always take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and think outside the box. As I mentioned in <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">my post about Shereef&#39;s video on the Dev Bootcamp culture</a>, I&#39;m excited to be in an environment where I am driving my own education and experience. It is going to force me to think differently about what I am learning, how I am learning, and how I apply my newfound skills.</p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="week3_technical.html" class="title-link">Tech talk: The advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 23, 2014</span></p>
      <p class="posttext">We spent the first two weeks of Phase 0 learning the basics of HTML and CSS, enough that we could build our own blog and <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html">website</a>. This week we shifted our focus to JavaScript, a language that is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. Fun fact: did you know that Java and JavaScript are two completely different, unrelated languages? I didn&#39;t either, <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/05/javascript/" target = "_blank">but they are.</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">When you try to load a traditional, static web page, your computer requests the files that store the page&#39;s information from the server, the server sends your computer the file, and then the browser displays the information. Anyone who looks at this page will see the exact same information and layout. JavaScript changes this and allows pages to be customized for each user. For example, JavaScript allow you to stay logged in to your Gmail or Facebook accounts so you don&#39;t need to re-enter your username and password each time you load those sites. </p>

      <p class="posttext">JavaScript is popular in web development because it allows designers to take a page and bring it to life.  Everything from animations to interactive content. For example, If I&#39;m reading a book via Amazon&#39;s Kindle Cloud Reader, JavaScript is used to allow me to turn the page. It allows Google Maps to give me directions based on the destination and starting point I input. All of these interactive scripts are run on the user&#39;s computer rather than on the original server that sent the file. This allows pages to run faster and more smoothly since the page isn&#39;t constantly pinging the server for information and waiting for a response, another major advantage of the language.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While JavaScript allows developers to bring web pages to life and do some pretty cool things with the web experience, it also comes with a few challenges and drawbacks. First up: security. JavaScript executes files on the client side (the user&#39;s computer, rather than on the server itself), which is what allows it to create a version of the web page that is custom to each user, but this can leave the computer vulnerable to viruses and other malware. The web page is interacting with the user&#39;s computer and the information stored there so without proper protection, the JavaScript scripts that run when a page is opened can pull information from the user&#39;s computer or leave harmful programs there. Browsers are built to protect against this and &quot;sandbox&quot; web pages so they are restricted from accessing parts of the computer not relevant to the page, however savvy developers with bad intentions are constantly looking for and finding ways to get around these restrictions, which keeps the makers of the major browsers on their toes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">A second disadvantage of JavaScript centers around page-ranking algorithms that search engines like Google use to decide the order in which they return results. These search engines use the content on a web page to determine how relevant it is to a specific query. If all or most of the page&#39;s content is wrapped up in JavaScript scripts that aren&#39;t run until the page is loaded in the browser, the algorithm can have hard time finding content to work off of to determine its relevance.</p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="responsive-web-design.html" class="title-link">Tech talk: responsive web design.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 17, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">As the popularity of mobile phones and tablets continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly common for users to view web content somewhere other than on their computer. Each new device seems to come with  different screen dimensions and ensuring that a page displays properly on each of these screens, regardless of their size, presents a new challenge for web designers. As a user, there’s nothing worse than trying to read an article on your iPhone and having to constantly scroll to the right because the line of text extends beyond the width of the screen. Enter responsive design.</p>

      <p class="posttext">With responsive design, pages are designed and optimized for viewing across multiple different screen sizes. I will be able to read that article on my iPhone without having to scroll to the right. The page will detect my screen size and will adjust the width of the text column accordingly. Images will be resized to fit properly in the screen, and the layout of the page could change as well. There is plenty of room to fit a navigation bar on the side of a page when viewing it on your desktop browser, but this would be too crammed with the limited width of a mobile screen so the navigation bar would likely be moved up above the main content when viewed on a smaller screen. For a deeper dive into the principles of responsive design, check out Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">article on the topic</a>.</p>

      <p class="posttext">For our second pairing challenge of the week, we were tasked with taking a basic webpage (see image below) and optimizing it for viewing across desktop, tablets, and mobile phones. My pair and I chose to use 480px for the mobile screen, 768px for the tablet screen, and anything larger than 768px for the desktop version.</p>

      <img class="displayed" id="responsive-webpage" src="../imgs/responsive-screenshot.png" />

      <p class="posttext">You can see our final product <a href="starting-point.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Play around with the dimensions of the browser and notice how the layout changes with the width. We&#8217;ve changed the color of the header for each different screen size: green for the desktop version, yellow for tablet, and blue for mobile.</p>

      <p class="posttext">The layout of the original website was done in pixels rather than percentages so when you adjusted the width of the screen, the text and images would continue off to the right of the screen forcing the user to scroll rather than automatically adjusting as they do now. For the tablet version we slightly reduced the size of the header and left navigation bar, which seemed a bit overbearing on the slightly smaller screen. The biggest change to the layout came with the mobile version. As mentioned above, the mobile screen is too narrow to have a navigation bar alongside the main content of a page so we moved it from the left side of the page to sit right under the header and above the main content on the page.</p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="pair-programming.html" class="title-link">Pairing is caring.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 17, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">One of the first things we were introduced to upon starting Phase 0 was the concept of pair programming. No, the DBC experience, thankfully, is not all about me sitting at my computer coding away and trying to solve problems on my own. The community is such a large part of the program and as part of that we will be spending a large percentage of our time programming with a partner.</p>
      <p class="posttext">How exactly does this work? There are a few different ways you can structure the relationship between the two people involved, but the model we will be using at DBC is the driver-navigator arrangement. The driver is the one typing the code while the navigator steers the overall focus and direction of what they are working on.  The two people switch roles frequently so that each has a chance to drive and navigate. Communication while pairing is critical - since two people are working so closely together on one task, each person involved needs to &quot;think out loud&quot; to avoid any confusion and to ensure they are both on the same page.</p>
      <p class="posttext">I had my first pairing session this week and was nervous going in - would I be able to add value?  Would I forget everything I had learned about HTML and CSS in the past two weeks? Would I remember to communicate enough? The thought of having to be articulate about a topic I wasn&#8217;t entirely comfortable with while working with someone I had only met minutes before over a Google Hangout was more than a little daunting. The last thing I wanted was for my pairing session to turn out like this: </p>

      <p id="comic-caption">Image courtesy of <a href="http://codingcomics.blogspot.com/2009/09/joys-of-pair-programming.html" target="_blank">CodingComics</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">Fortunately, none of these things happened and my first pairing session was a success. Our challenge was straightforward: create a website that talked about pair programming. This was a great first project to pair on since it allowed us to focus on getting comfortable with the roles and the process of pairing itself rather than on working through a difficult technical challenge.</p>

      <p class="posttext">You can take a look at the page we created <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/gps1.1.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Warning: be prepared to  be unimpressed (and maybe slightly horrified) by the (lack of) styling on the page. Ok, I&#8217;ll say it, the page is pretty ugly. But creating a beautifully designed page about pair programming wasn&#8217;t the point of the challenge. The point was to learn about the pair programming process, and that we did. It&#8217;s going to take a while before I feel fully comfortable in either role or before it feels natural to vocalize my every thought, but I see incredible value in working with a partner in this way and am excited to continue practicing.</p>

        <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="week2_technical.html" class="title-link">Tech talk: positioning elements in CSS.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 16, 2014</span></p>
        <p class="posttext">When I started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (DBC), I didn't know anything about front-end web development. I had made a few edits to the html tags on a Blogger site I used to keep but beyond that, I wouldn't have known where to start in creating a web page. Fast forward two weeks, and I've built <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html" target = "_blank">my own website</a>, including this blog, from scratch using HTML and CSS. For those who are unfamiliar (like I was before DBC), HTML is used to put all the elements (like images or this text) on the page while CSS is used to position and style these elements.</p>

        <p class="posttext">Positioning elements has been one of the hardest concepts for me to grasp. Getting each piece of text and each border in the exact right spot was a character-building experience. Tears may have been shed. So how does positioning work in CSS? I’m so glad you asked. Let me give a quick overview.</p>

        <p class="posttext">By default, elements are given a static position. If you don't tell them where to go, they will fall on the page in the order in which they are written in the HTML document, one right after another. If you only have one element on the page, say a red square, it will plop itself in the upper left corner of the page. As you add more elements (or red squares) to a page, they will continue to line up horizontally, moving down to the next line once the top line is full.</p>

        <p class="posttext">There are three types of positioning that can be applied: relative, absolute, and fixed. With relative positioning, you move the element relative to where it would have fallen if it had no positioning applied and had the default static position. You can apply positioning attributes to move the element around. For example, if I add top: 10px, the element will be shifted down 10 pixels from where the element would have normally fallen because I've added a 10 pixel margin to the top of the element. If I do not add any positioning attributes (e.g. I don't tell the element to move up, down, right, or left) then the element will remain in it's default position.</p>

        <p class="posttext">With relative positioning, placement of an element is still dependent on the flow of all elements within the document. You are moving an element relative to where it would have fallen. Absolute positioning takes the element out of this flow and allows you to place it anywhere on the page. Like with the relative position, you use positioning attributes on the top, bottom, right, and left to adjust the location, but in this case you are adjusting it relative to either the top of the page or the element's parent. An element's parent is the element that contains that element. For example, the parent element of this paragraph of text is the rectangular container that outlines this blog post. Absolute positioning allows me to decide where this paragraph is displayed relative to the position of this container. If an element does not have a parent element or if the parent element has a static position, then absolute positioning allows you to to move the element relative to the top left of the page.</p>

        <p class="posttext">Finally, the fixed position locks an element in a specific spot on the page, even when you move up and down the page. Keep your eye on the navigation bar at the top of the page and scroll down. See how it stays in place while the "Meg Makes" and the top of the post flow up underneath it? This happens because the navigation bar has a fixed position - it is anchored to that spot and will not move at all.</p>

      <p class="posttext">There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there, but one of the things that I think sets Dev Bootcamp apart is their emphasis on creating well rounded engineers who will thrive in their post-DBC workplace rather than focusing exclusively on teaching students to code. This holistic approach along with the way they empower students to take control of their education really make the program stand out and after watching <a href ="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">this fireside chat</a> with DBC founder Shereef Bishay, I'm even more excited to be part of the DBC family.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In the video, Shereef discusses the two different mindsets he sees in students using a restaurant analogy: students are either sitting at the table or working in the kitchen.  He urges students to choose the latter path and take ownership and responsibility over their time at DBC. Come in, make a mess, and amaze yourself with how much you are able to learn and teach in nine short weeks. He warns against just "ordering off the menu" and feeling you are owed or entitled to a certain experience.</p>

      <p class="posttext">It's incredibly inspiring to know that what I get out of DBC is completely in my control. I'm pumped to start and to see what I'm capable of. I'm excited to test my limits and push myself harder than I ever have before. I'm not going to lie, I'm a little nervous. It's going to be a intense and a complete emotional roller coaster, but I also know that if I felt completely confident about the program that I wouldn't be pushing myself hard enough. Let's do this!</p>

      <p><span class="posttitle"><a href="t1-compare-websites.html" class="title-link">Website design and user experience.</a></span><br><span class="postdate">August 9, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">First DBC blog post! Very exciting. This week we learned about design and user experience to help us put together our blogs. This whole process really forced me to think about some of the characteristics that I value when looking at other websites. There are a few things that are top of mind:</p>

      <p>
        <ul  class="posttext">
          <li><strong>Clean and simple:</strong> Is the page uncluttered? Does it provide just the right amount of information without causing me to get distracted?</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to navigate:</strong> Can I easily find what I'm looking for? Is it clear where I should focus my attention? Does the flow of the content make sense?</li>
          <li><strong>Engaging:</strong> does the website provide some sort of value? Does it keep me interested?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="posttext">Three websites come to mind that really exemplify these characteristics: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="http://www.shopbop.com/"target="_blank">Shopbop</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/"target="_blank">Google</a>. The New Yorker's website has a large amount of content, but they do a great job of organizing it so that the user is not overwhelmed when looking at the page. I find text-heavy websites difficult to process quickly. Since The New Yorker is a magazine and people go to their website to read their articles, the website could have easily been primarily text based with a laundry list of article titles for users to sift through. One of the things I really enjoy about the site is that they do a nice job of bringing the top articles to life by adding images and a sentence or two with additional details about the article. This allows me as user to make a quick decision around whether I want to click the link and read the article or not. Additionally, they curate the experience. They don't list all articles in the current issue on the front page. That information is easy to navigate to, but they focus the users attention and highlight a few key articles the want you to look at.</p>

      <img class="displayed" src="shopbop.png" />

      <p class="posttext">Shopbop is my favorite place to shop online. When I'm looking at clothing online, pictures play a huge role when I am deciding whether to buy an item or not. Shopbop does a fantastic job of merchandising the clothing with high-quality photos that speak for themselves. The white background and clean layout really make the photos pop and draw the user in. They do a fantastic job of creating emotion through the photos. While they are in the business of selling clothing, they are really selling a lifestyle that they want the user to aspire to, with the clothes helping facilitate that lifestyle. Shopbop is also incredibly easy to navigate. Large tabs along the bottom of the header direct the user to more specific categories, which allows even a new user to quickly find what ever she is looking for.</p>

      <p class="posttext">You can't really get more simple than the Google website, and that's one of the main reasons I like it so much. It does one thing -- lets you search for content on the Internet -- and it does that one thing really well. All the white space on the page focuses your attention on the search box. There is no question about where you are supposed to look on the page or what value the site provides, which creates a great user experience. While Google now has many different products and services, their minimalist website focuses the user on their bread and butter: search.</p>

      <p class="posttext">All three of these websites serve very different purposes, but to me they are all great examples of how strong design impacts user experience. And as you can probably tell from the sites I mentioned here and the design of this blog, I'm a big fan of minimalist white backgrounds with black text.</p>
