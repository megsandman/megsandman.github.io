      <p class="posttext">Conflict is an inevitable part of life. The world would be a pretty boring place if we all agreed about everything all the time. That said, how we deal with conflicts can have a dramatic impact on our lives and relationships with others. When dealing with conflict, we can often apply some of the same coping mechanisms we use for dealing with shame. Dr. Donald L. Nathanson&#39;s Compass of Shame provides an interesting framework that applies nicely to the different ways someone can handle an emotional conflict.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As I have had conversations with friends and various people I meet about Dev Bootcamp, the question of what language I&#39;m learning virtually always comes up. When I say Ruby, I&#39;m frequently asked &quot;Oh, like Ruby on Rails?&quot; My response to date has gone something along the lines of an unsure &quot;Umm, yes?&quot; I didn&#39;t actually know what Rails was or how it differed from Ruby so I decided to do a little research to better understand the relationship between Ruby and Rails.</p>

      <p class="posttext">This week we dove into SQL - short for Structured Query Language - and have had an introduction to databases and database management systems (DMS). The DMS is the piece that handles the sets of information and SQL is a language that gives users a way to interact with that data. SQL allows you to create a database, add or delete information from it, or pull information from it based on specified parameters.</p>

      <p class="posttext">When I think about the times in my life that I&#39;ve been happiest or most proud, a few themes come to mind: adventure, challenge, close relationships, growth, integrity, meaningful work, personal development. Of these, growth is one that I value most. It&#39;s important to me that I am always learning and developing, whether it be in my career, my relationships, or in another area of interest and this is exactly what led me to Dev Bootcamp in the first place. I want to be the best possible version of myself that I can be, and the only way to do that is to constantly be growing and improving.</p>

      <p class="posttext">I find human behavior fascinating. I wrote my senior thesis in college on how non-concious factors impact human behavior and the topic is one that is near and dear to my heart.

      <p class="posttext">In last week&#39;s technical post, we built our own Ruby class Dog. In addition to giving each Dog object certain characteristics, the class defined several actions that can be performed by each instance of the class such as aging the dog a year through the method one_year_older or updating the dog’s favorite treat with the method update_fave_treat. one_year_older and update_fave_treat are both instance methods - they are performed by one particular instance of the class.</p>

      <p class="posttext">I've written in a <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/pair-programming.html">previous post</a> about how pair programming and working through challenges with the other students in the cohort plays a big roll in DBC. While we do have a challenge that we must work on individually each week, I&#39;ve found myself pairing with others on most of the other challenges. After my first few pairing session, I realized that working with another student allows me to learn so much more than I could compared with just trying to solve the challenges on my own. I&#39;ve learned as much about Ruby from working with other students as I have through reading texts like <a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a> and having my peers explain a complicated concept in a slightly different way has helped me understand the material better, as has explaining concepts to the person I&#39;m working with.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As I touched on in last week&#39;s technical post, Ruby is an object oriented language and each object belongs to a class.

      <p class="posttext">Ruby is an object oriented language. This means that everything in Ruby is an object and programs written in Ruby create objects, decide what actions these objects can perform, and decide how these objects interact with other objects. Every object has a class, which is a data structure that groups together objects that have the same behaviors and properties. Ruby allows users to define their own classes but also has several built in classes such as strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Before starting Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp asked students to read up on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target = "_blank">Gregorc Model</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target = "_blank">quiz</a> to determine our own thinking style. The Gregorc Model looks at thinking styles along two dimensions: perceptual quality, which can be either concrete or abstract, and ordering ability, which can be either sequential or random. My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. What does that mean? I like order. I like structure. I don&#39;t do well with ambiguity or abstract ideas.

      <p class="posttext">As the popularity of mobile phones and tablets continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly common for users to view web content somewhere other than on their computer. Each new device seems to come with  different screen dimensions and ensuring that a page displays properly on each of these screens, regardless of their size, presents a new challenge for web designers.
