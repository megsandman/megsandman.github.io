      <p class="posttext">When I think about the times in my life that I&#39;ve been happiest or most proud, a few themes come to mind: adventure, challenge, close relationships, growth, integrity, meaningful work, personal development. Of these, growth is one that I value most. It&#39;s important to me that I am always learning and developing, whether it be in my career, my relationships, or in another area of interest and this is exactly what led me to Dev Bootcamp in the first place. I want to be the best possible version of myself that I can be, and the only way to do that is to constantly be growing and improving.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While growth is particularly important to me, I try to live up to and embody all of these values as much as possible. They encapsulate what&#39;s most important to me...<a href="week7_cultural.html" class="read_more"> read more</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">I find human behavior fascinating. I wrote my senior thesis in college on how non-concious factors impact human behavior and the topic is one that is near and dear to my heart. It never ceases to amaze me that our actions and behavior can be so heavily affected by influences we are not aware of. One very powerful influence on our behavior is the stereotypes with which we associate.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In last week&#39;s technical post, we built our own Ruby class Dog. In addition to giving each Dog object certain characteristics, the class defined several actions that can be performed by each instance of the class such as aging the dog a year through the method one_year_older or updating the dogâ€™s favorite treat with the method update_fave_treat. one_year_older and update_fave_treat are both instance methods - they are performed by one particular instance of the class.</p>

      <p class="posttext">I've written in a <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/pair-programming.html">previous post</a> about how pair programming and working through challenges with the other students in the cohort plays a big roll in DBC. While we do have a challenge that we must work on individually each week, I&#39;ve found myself pairing with others on most of the other challenges. After my first few pairing session, I realized that working with another student allows me to learn so much more than I could compared with just trying to solve the challenges on my own. I&#39;ve learned as much about Ruby from working with other students as I have through reading texts like <a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a> and having my peers explain a complicated concept in a slightly different way has helped me understand the material better, as has explaining concepts to the person I&#39;m working with.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As I touched on in last week&#39;s technical post, Ruby is an object oriented language and each object belongs to a class. Classes are like a blueprint for objects - they group together attributes and actions (or methods) allowing you to easily create a large number of new objects that behave in the same way.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As I shared the news that I was going to do Dev Bootcamp and learn to code with friends and acquaintances, everyone has been very supportive and excited for me. Invariably, after sharing their excitement for me, each reaction has typically included a comment along the lines of &quot;we need more female programmers&quot; or &quot;a woman who codes?

      <p class="posttext">Ruby is an object oriented language. This means that everything in Ruby is an object and programs written in Ruby create objects, decide what actions these objects can perform, and decide how these objects interact with other objects. Every object has a class, which is a data structure that groups together objects that have the same behaviors and properties. Ruby allows users to define their own classes but also has several built in classes such as strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Before starting Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp asked students to read up on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target = "_blank">Gregorc Model</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target = "_blank">quiz</a> to determine our own thinking style. The Gregorc Model looks at thinking styles along two dimensions: perceptual quality, which can be either concrete or abstract, and ordering ability, which can be either sequential or random. My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. What does that mean? I like order. I like structure. I don&#39;t do well with ambiguity or abstract ideas. For those of you who know me well, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As the popularity of mobile phones and tablets continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly common for users to view web content somewhere other than on their computer. Each new device seems to come with  different screen dimensions and ensuring that a page displays properly on each of these screens, regardless of their size, presents a new challenge for web designers. As a user, thereâ€™s nothing worse than trying to read an article on your iPhone and having to constantly scroll to the right because the line of text extends beyond the width of the screen. Enter responsive design.</p>

No, the DBC experience, thankfully, is not all about me sitting at my computer coding away and trying to solve problems on my own.

        <p class="posttext">When I started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (DBC), I didn't know anything about front-end web development. I had made a few edits to the html tags on a Blogger site I used to keep but beyond that, I wouldn't have known where to start in creating a web page. Fast forward two weeks, and I've built <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html" target = "_blank">my own website</a>, including this blog, from scratch using HTML and CSS. For those who are unfamiliar (like I was before DBC), HTML is used to put all the elements (like images or this text) on the page while CSS is used to position and style these elements.</p>

      <p class="posttext">There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there, but one of the things that I think sets Dev Bootcamp apart is their emphasis on creating well rounded engineers who will thrive in their post-DBC workplace rather than focusing exclusively on teaching students to code. This holistic approach along with the way they empower students to take control of their education really make the program stand out and after watching <a href ="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">this fireside chat</a> with DBC founder Shereef Bishay, I'm even more excited to be part of the DBC family.</p>
