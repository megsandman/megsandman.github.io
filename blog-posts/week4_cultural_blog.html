      <p><span class="posttitle">Diversity in tech.</span><br><span class="postdate">August 31, 2014</span></p>
      <p class="posttext">As I shared the news that I was going to do Dev Bootcamp and learn to code with friends and acquaintances, everyone has been very supportive and excited for me. Invariably, after sharing their excitement for me, each reaction has typically included a comment along the lines of &quot;we need more female programmers&quot; or &quot;a woman who codes? You&#39;re going to  be so marketable.&quot; </p>

      <p class="posttext">Inside, I cringed each time I heard this. In the future, I want to be recognized for my skills as a developer, not because I'm a woman who is also able to code. Hearing this over and over again also made me slightly wary of this new world I was going into. Would I be accepted as a female developer in a male dominated community? Would this present barriers for me that I haven't encountered in the past?</p>

      <p class="posttext">Recently, many companies in Silicon Valley have released reports detailing the gender and ethnic breakdown of their staff. The results are not likely surprising to anyone. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-twitter-we-can-be-proud-of" target = "_blank">Twitter's report</a> showed that 70% of their workforce and 90% of the technical workforce is male and about 60% of both groups is white.</p>

      <p class="posttext">At Google, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">the numbers are nearly identical</a> with men making up 70% of the US workforce and whites making up 61%. The <a href="http://engineering.pinterest.com/post/92753543099/diversity-and-inclusion-at-pinterest">numbers at Pinterest</a> are slightly more encouraging: 60% of their overall workforce and 79% of their tech team is male while 50% of their overall workforce is Caucasian.</p>

      <p class="posttext">The good news is that the conversation about diversity is one that the industry is having. Companies like the ones above are being transparent about how big the problem actually is and many have launched plans for programs aimed at bringing more women and minorities to tech.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Google recently announced it's <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com.tr/2014/06/made-with-code-an-effort-by-google-to-inspire-girls-to-code.html">Made with Code</a> initiative to encourage girls to learn to program and choose careers in technical fields. Twitter and Pinterest both support organizations and events focused on encouraging minorities in tech such as Girls Who Code, Out for Tech, Black Girls CODE, and Year Up.</p>

      <p class="posttext">As a woman in tech, I hope I can do my part to encourage more of my female peers to join me in the industry and to help rebalance the gender ratios in engineering and computer science related roles.</p>
