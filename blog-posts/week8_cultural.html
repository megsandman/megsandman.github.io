      <p><span class="posttitle">Conflict and the Compass of Shame.</span><br><span class="postdate">September 27, 2014</span></p>

      <p class="posttext">Conflict is an inevitable part of life. The world would be a pretty boring place if we all agreed about everything all the time. That said, how we deal with conflicts can have a dramatic impact on our lives and relationships with others. When dealing with conflict, we can often apply some of the same coping mechanisms we use for dealing with shame. Dr. Donald L. Nathanson&#39;s Compass of Shame provides an interesting framework that applies nicely to the different ways someone can handle an emotional conflict.</p>

      <p class="posttext">The Compass of Shame breaks a person&#39;s response down into four different buckets:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li>Withdrawal: avoids addressing the conflict through isolation or detaching from the situation</li>
      <li>Attack Self: stays connected to the situation but blames self, which can cause feelings to build up in an unhealthy way</li>
      <li>Avoidance: hide feelings as best as possible, often by drawing attention to oneself through over the top behaviors</li>
      <li>Attack Other: blame and project feelings onto others </li></ul>

      <p class="posttext">None of the four points on the Compass of Shame are healthy and each coping strategy has it&#39;s own repercussions on one&#39;s own well being and on one&#39;s relationships with others. When I am faced with conflict, my immediate reaction is to withdraw. I don&#39;t like conflict so I tend to try to detach myself from the situation to avoid having to deal with the emotions I&#39;m feeling.</p>

      <p class="posttext">One of the more recent emotional conflicts I have had was with a friend of mine. This particular friend has a habit of consistently being 20-30 minutes late whenever we had made plans and frequently would cancel at the last minute. While I tried to be understanding, as this happened more and more I became frustrated. I interpreted her behaviour as her essentially saying that she thought her time was more important than mine and didn&#39;t respect me or my time. Rather than addressing this head-on, I let my emotions fester and simply stopped making plans with her. </p>

      <p class="posttext">The conflict eventually came to a head when she noticed that I had been withdrawing from our friendship.  She was frustrated with me because of the lack of effort and time I was putting into our relationship and I was hurt because I interpreted the way she was acting to mean that she didn&#39;t respect me or my time. After an emotional conversation we were able to resolve things and understand where the other was coming from, but we could have saved eachother a lot of pain by just being open and honest from the beginning. </p>

      <p class="posttext">In retrospect, I wish I had said something sooner. Instead of letting my feelings build up inside me, I could have let my friend know how I was feeling. She had no way of knowing why I was frustrated, and withdrawing from the situation only made things worse. As easy as it is to say this now, I know it will be so hard in the moment to catch myself detaching from a conflict, but doing so will allow me to address things head on and handle my feelings in a more solution-oriented way.</p>
