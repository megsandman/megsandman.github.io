      <p class="posttext">Before starting Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp asked students to read up on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Model</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> to determine our own thinking style. The Gregorc Model looks at thinking styles along two dimensions: perceptual quality, which can be either concrete or abstract, and ordering ability, which can be either sequential or random. My personal thinking style is concrete sequential. What does that mean? I like order. I like structure. I don&#39;t do well with ambiguity or abstract ideas. For those of you who know me well, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In the first three weeks of Phase 0, my biggest struggle has been remembering how to be a student again. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve been focused on learning and digesting large volumes of new information, and I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s been difficult for me to work in large chunks of time without getting distracted or losing focus.</p>

      <p class="posttext">I&#39;ve changed a few things about the way I approached the work this past week that helped me get past my initial challenge. First, I broke down the blocks of time I was spending working into smaller chunks. I gave myself more frequent breaks, and improved my ability to focus. Instead of telling myself that I would work for two hours straight, I divided that up into 4 30-minute blocks with a short break in between each. I&#39;ve found that I&#39;ve been able to accomplish so much more and sustain my focus by working in shorter bursts.</p>


      <p class="posttext">The second strategy I used was to organize my week up front. Each week we are given around 10 challenges that need to be completed with each challenge including reading and other learning materials to get through in addition to the exercises. By mapping out everything that I needed to get done that week in a format that was easily digestible, I was able to give myself a clearer picture of the assignments and could develop a plan of attack. I started setting individual deadlines for each challenge so that I wasn&#39;t tempted to procrastinate knowing that I had the whole week to complete the work.</p>
      <p class="posttext"></p>

      <p class="posttext">Reading about my thinking style and the characteristics associated with it has also highlighted an area that I would like to improve on: experimenting and being more creative. I find that I can get so focused on following directions and doing things &quot;right&quot; that I don&#39;t always take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and think outside the box. As I mentioned in <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/blog-posts/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">my post about Shereef&#39;s video on the Dev Bootcamp culture</a>, I&#39;m excited to be in an environment where I am driving my own education and experience. It is going to force me to think differently about what I am learning, how I am learning, and how I apply my newfound skills.</p>
