      <p><span class="posttitle">Tech talk: The advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript.</span><br><span class="postdate">August 23, 2014</span></p>
      <p class="posttext">We spent the first two weeks of Phase 0 learning the basics of HTML and CSS, enough that we could build our own blog and <a href="http://megsandman.github.io/index.html">website</a>. This week we shifted our focus to JavaScript, a language that is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. Fun fact: did you know that Java and JavaScript are two completely different, unrelated languages? I didn&#39;t either, <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/05/javascript/" target = "_blank">but they are.</a></p>

      <p class="posttext">When you try to load a traditional, static web page, your computer requests the files that store the page&#39;s information from the server, the server sends your computer the file, and then the browser displays the information. Anyone who looks at this page will see the exact same information and layout. JavaScript changes this and allows pages to be customized for each user. For example, JavaScript allow you to stay logged in to your Gmail or Facebook accounts so you don&#39;t need to re-enter your username and password each time you load those sites. </p>

      <p class="posttext">JavaScript is popular in web development because it allows designers to take a page and bring it to life.  Everything from animations to interactive content. For example, If I&#39;m reading a book via Amazon&#39;s Kindle Cloud Reader, JavaScript is used to allow me to turn the page. It allows Google Maps to give me directions based on the destination and starting point I input. All of these interactive scripts are run on the user&#39;s computer rather than on the original server that sent the file. This allows pages to run faster and more smoothly since the page isn&#39;t constantly pinging the server for information and waiting for a response, another major advantage of the language.</p>

      <p class="posttext">While JavaScript allows developers to bring web pages to life and do some pretty cool things with the web experience, it also comes with a few challenges and drawbacks. First up: security. JavaScript executes files on the client side (the user&#39;s computer, rather than on the server itself), which is what allows it to create a version of the web page that is custom to each user, but this can leave the computer vulnerable to viruses and other malware. The web page is interacting with the user&#39;s computer and the information stored there so without proper protection, the JavaScript scripts that run when a page is opened can pull information from the user&#39;s computer or leave harmful programs there. Browsers are built to protect against this and &quot;sandbox&quot; web pages so they are restricted from accessing parts of the computer not relevant to the page, however savvy developers with bad intentions are constantly looking for and finding ways to get around these restrictions, which keeps the makers of the major browsers on their toes.</p>

      <p class="posttext">A second disadvantage of JavaScript centers around page-ranking algorithms that search engines like Google use to decide the order in which they return results. These search engines use the content on a web page to determine how relevant it is to a specific query. If all or most of the page&#39;s content is wrapped up in JavaScript scripts that aren&#39;t run until the page is loaded in the browser, the algorithm can have hard time finding content to work off of to determine its relevance.</p>
