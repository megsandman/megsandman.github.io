      <p class="posttext">There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there, but one of the things that I think sets Dev Bootcamp apart is their emphasis on creating a well rounded engineer who will thrive in their post-DBC work place rather than focusing exclusively on teaching students to code. This holistic approach along with the way they empower students to take control of their education really make the program stand out and after watching <a href ="http://vimeo.com/85001014">this fireside chat</a> with DBC founder Shereef Bishay, I'm even more excited to be part of the DBC family.</p>

      <p class="posttext">In the video, Shereef discusses the two different mindsets he sees in students using a restaurant analogy: students are either sitting at the table or working in the kitchen.  He urges students to choose the later path and take ownership and responsibility over their time at DBC. Come in, make a mess, and amaze yourself with how much you are able to learn and teach in nine short weeks. He warns against just "ordering off the menu" and feeling you are owed or entitled to a certain experience.</p>

      <p class="posttext">It's incredibly inspiring to know that what I get out of DBC is completely in my control. I'm pumped to start and to see what I'm capable of. I'm excited to test my limits and push myself harder than I ever have before. I'm not going to lie, I'm a little nervous. It's going to be a intense and a complete emotional roller coaster, but I also know that if I felt completely confident about the program that I wouldn't be pushing myself hard enough. Let's do this!</p>
