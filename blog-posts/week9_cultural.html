      <p class="posttext">As I&#39;ve started coding, I&#39;ve quickly learned that Google is my new best friend. With most challenges I inevitably reach a point where I get stuck: I don&#39;t remember the syntax for a particular method, I am not getting the output I expected, I can&#39;t figure out why I am getting an error message, the possibilities are endless. While the books I have been reading have been helpful in understanding the theory behind Ruby, nothing beats the power of Google when it comes to troubleshooting.</p>

      <p class="posttext">Here are a few tips and best practices I&#39;ve learned about crafting questions to get the best response:</p>

      <ul class="posttext"><li><u>Do your research first.</u> There is a wealth of knowledge already out there. I&#39;ve found that nearly all of the questions I have had or issues I have run into have already been posted and responded to on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.Even if you can&#39;t find the exact answer you are looking for, it can be valuable to provide links to questions that are similar to what you are researching but not quite exactly the same. This will not only provide credibility to your question by showing that you&#39;ve already put in the leg work but can also help ensure that you don&#39;t get the same, non-applicable responses.</li><br>
      <li><u>Craft a title that summarizes the problem.</u>The title is the first thing that other users on the forum will see and will heavily influence whether someone answers your question or not. I tend to be long-winded and can find it tricky to sum up a problem in a brief sentence. Using Google to find information has helped me hone my research skills and over the past few weeks I&#39;ve learned to identify which keywords need to be included to get the best results. When posting on forums, I&#39;ve found that the best titles are often very close in wording to the phrases I have used as I&#39;ve searched Google.</li><br>
      <li><u>Clearly outline what information you are trying to find.</u> Make sure that anyone reading your question can easily identify exactly what you are looking for. The last thing you want is for someone to read your question and not know how to respond, not because they don&#39;t know the material but because they can&#39;t figure out what you are asking. Along the same vein, make sure your question is actually a question and not simply a statement of what is going along. It is important to include the expected outcome and to highlight how the outcome you are getting deviates from the expected outcome.</li><br>
      <li><u>Include sample code.</u> While giving background on what you are   trying to do and the problem you are running into is important, supplementing this information with your code is incredibly helpful. Including your code will give anyone who is reading your question a clear picture into how you are going about solving the problem and why you might be running into errors. Limit the code you include to just the few lines with which you are having problems - you don&#39;t need to include the complete program!</li><br>
      <li><u>Proofread.</u> No one likes to read text riddled with spelling errors or typos. Not only do they make sentences more difficult to understand, but these errors can make you look unprofessional and may limit the responses you receive. Ensure that your sentences are clear and that someone who is unfamiliar with the problem you are facing would be able to understand the situation with only the information given in your post.</li><br>
      <li><u>Reply to any responses.</u>
        Sites like Stack Overflow are only as valuable as they are because they have dedicated communities that voluntarily respond to other user&#39;s questions. Make sure to show your appreciation by responding to any answers you get with a thank you. Did their suggestion help you out? Let them know! Was their answer not quite what you were looking for? Continue the dialogue to see if you can get to the information you&#39;re trying to find. They took the time to answer your question so be sure to take the time to leave feedback on their response.</li> </ul>
